# Clerk Authentication Setup Guide

## ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! 
Your Clerk authentication system has been successfully installed and configured. Here's what you need to do to complete the setup:

## Step 1: Create a Clerk Account
1. Go to [https://dashboard.clerk.com](https://dashboard.clerk.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Create a new application

## Step 2: Get Your API Keys
1. In your Clerk Dashboard, go to "API Keys"
2. Copy your **Publishable Key** and **Secret Key**
3. Update your `.env.local` file:

```env
# Replace these with your actual keys from Clerk Dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your-actual-publishable-key-here
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your-actual-secret-key-here
```

## Step 3: Configure Webhook (Optional - Can Skip for Testing)
**Note: Webhooks require a publicly accessible URL. For local development, you can skip this step initially and set it up later when deploying.**

### Option A: Skip Webhooks for Now
You can test authentication without webhooks. Just comment out or remove the webhook secret from `.env.local`:
```env
# WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your-actual-webhook-secret-here
```

### Option B: Use ngrok for Local Development
1. Install ngrok: `npm install -g ngrok`
2. Start your dev server: `npm run dev`
3. In another terminal: `ngrok http 3000`
4. Use the ngrok URL: `https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/clerk`
5. In Clerk Dashboard, go to "Webhooks"
6. Create endpoint with the ngrok URL
7. Select events: `user.created`, `user.updated`, `user.deleted`
8. Copy the webhook secret and update `.env.local`

### Option C: Deploy to Vercel First
1. Deploy your app: `vercel`
2. Use your Vercel URL: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/webhooks/clerk`

## Step 4: Test the Authentication Flow
1. Restart your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000`
3. You should see "Sign In" and "Sign Up" buttons in the navigation
4. Try signing up with a test account
5. After signing in, you should see your user profile in the navigation

## What's Been Set Up For You:

### âœ… Authentication Pages
- `/sign-in` - Custom styled sign-in page
- `/sign-up` - Custom styled sign-up page

### âœ… Protected Routes
- `/crm` - CRM & Lead management
- `/projects` - Project management
- `/clients` - Client portal
- `/analytics` - Analytics dashboard
- `/qa` - QA & Launch tools

### âœ… User Management
- User profiles with Clerk UserButton
- Automatic user sync with Convex database
- Webhook integration for user events

### âœ… UI Components
- Custom-styled authentication forms
- User navigation component
- Responsive design matching your app theme

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Invalid publishable key"
- Make sure you copied the correct publishable key from Clerk Dashboard
- Ensure the key starts with `pk_test_` or `pk_live_`
- Restart your development server after updating environment variables

### Issue: Authentication pages not loading
- Check that your middleware is properly configured
- Ensure environment variables are set correctly
- Check browser console for any JavaScript errors

### Issue: Webhook not working
- Make sure your webhook URL is accessible (use ngrok for local development)
- Verify the webhook secret matches your Clerk Dashboard
- Check the webhook logs in Clerk Dashboard

## Next Steps
1. Customize the authentication appearance in your components
2. Add role-based permissions if needed
3. Configure social login providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)
4. Set up production environment variables when deploying
